## 10th WOSP-C 2025

The Workshop on Challenges in Performance Methods for Software Development (WOSP-C) serves as a forum for discussions on novel and unresolved challenges in the field of software performance engineering.
The workshop encompasses topics such as performance assurance processes, the interplay between performance and software architecture, performance testing and debugging, and performance monitoring. The primary areas of interest for the workshop remain consistent with previous editions, but this edition scope will also extend to include additional novel topics.


## Program
The 10th WOSP-C 2025 is co-located with ICPE 2025, and it will be held on May 2025 in Toronto.

Extraordinarily, and just for this single edition, the WOSP-C program is fused with the program of the [3rd workshop AIPerf and Optimization in the LLM World](https://sites.google.com/view/aiprefllm2025).

WOSP-C's specific contribution to the combined schedule will be a panel focused on discussing two key areas: the challenges encountered when applying AI within Performance Engineering, and conversely, the benefits that classic Performance Engineering techniques can bring to AI.

**_Closing the Loop: Building Self-Adaptive Software for Continuous Performance Engineering_**

_Abstract_: 

Cloud computing and cloud-native platforms have rendered runtime environments more malleable. Simultaneously, the growing demand for flexible and agile software applications and services has driven the emergence of self-adaptive architectures. These architectures, in turn, facilitate software performance modeling, tuning, optimization, and scaling in a continuous manner, blurring the boundary between development-time and run-time. Self-adaptive software employs feedback loop controllers inspired by control theory or variations of the Monitoring-Analysis-Planning-Acting (MAPE) architecture. Whether implemented in a centralized or decentralized manner, most controllers utilize performance models that are learned or tuned at run-time. This shift implies that software is designed to be observable and controllable during execution, presupposing the co-design of software applications and their runtime controllers. 
This talk commences with a succinct overview of the evolution of self-adaptive software, accentuating key milestones along the journey. Subsequently, recent advancements in software performance modeling at runtime and the role of learning-enabled performance management during software operation are presented. 
Two recent works are highlighted: one focusing on constructing robust performance models to sustain continuous operation and deployment of cloud-native software, and the other on utilizing multimodal models for performance anomaly detection. The former supports cloud operations like continuous deployment of co-located applications, migration, consolidation of services, or scaling in response to workloads or interferences. The latter is tailored to support performance anomaly detection, localization, and identification of root causes, facilitating swift remediation of faults using generative AI. The final segment of the talk delves into current challenges in developing self-adaptive systems, presenting insights from a recent survey on the state of self-adaptive software in the industry and the challenges perceived by practitioners.

**_25+ years of Software Performance: From Integrated System Modelling to ML-based Analysis, What’s Next?_**

_Abstract_: 

A new era has been opened at the end of last century in the performance analysis research area, when an explicit and independent role has started to be given to software in performance analysis of computing systems. Indeed, software has moved from being a monolithic element, strictly dependent on the platform where it is deployed and exclusively aimed at producing values to parameterize a platform model, to become an independent model itself, with its own components and interactions. This change has impacted all fields of this research area, such as: modeling languages, processes for analysis and synthesis of software models, platform model parameterization, performance model solution techniques, interpretation of results, benchmarking and performance testing. It has also represented one of the triggers that lead to the birth of a research community around the computing system performance issues strictly related to software aspects. Indeed, in 1998 the first ACM Workshop on Software and Performance (WOSP) took place, with the aim of getting together researchers and practitioners of software area with the ones of the performance area, so to offer a playground where different skills and expertise could join and originate a new vision on the role of software in performance assessment. This talk attempts to reconstruct the road of software performance research that has started at the time of the first WOSP event in 1998 down to today events (i.e., ICPE conference, WOSP-C and other workshops). The spirit of the talk is to observe the evolution of this research area, including successful and (apparently) unsuccessful directions. Some promising directions will be tentatively sketched by “standing on the shoulders of giants”. -->
